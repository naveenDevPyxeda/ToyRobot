* The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, default of 5 units x 5 units
* There are no other obstructions on the table surface
* The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction
* Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed
